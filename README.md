# Daily Data Structure and Algorithm LeetCode and Codeforces Challenge

Welcome to the **Daily Data Structure and Algorithm LeetCode and Codeforces Challenge** repository! This repository is dedicated to improving problem-solving skills and mastering data structures and algorithms by tackling daily challenges from popular platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) and [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com).

## Description

This repository serves as a personal playground for honing algorithm and coding skills. It includes problems from:

- **LeetCode:** Covering topics such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more.
- **CodeForces:** Featuring competitive programming challenges to test and improve algorithmic thinking.

The goal is to document each challenge thoroughly — including the problem statement, code implementation, and additional insights — making it easier to review key concepts and learn from past solutions.
